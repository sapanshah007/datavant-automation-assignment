# Requirements:
● Preferred frameworks - Cypress preferred, Playwright secondary, Selenium or other frameworks are alright as well
● Upload the solution to GitHub

# What We Look For:
● Proper architecture that allows for scalability, maintainability, and a reasonable degree of flexibility regarding future, additional requirements
● Clean and organized code that can be read and understood by others. Style counts!
● Be prepared to demonstrate what you’ve built and talk about all parts and decisions fluently. Be able to explain your architecture and design choices. Be comfortable talking about the pros and cons of your approach vs. other approaches you may have considered.

# Important!
All work should be yours! An occasional StackOverflow, Cypress Blog (or an equivalent website) search is, of course, permitted; but please keep these to a reasonable minimum. If you absolutely must use content from StackOverflow (et al.), please cite the exact URL that you used. The goal of this is that the work you provide is your work, not someone else’s – use your best judgment.
